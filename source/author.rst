.. topic:: About Me:  

    I am a DevOps engineer by day and a Red Team enthusiast by night. I enjoy working with Kubernetes, Docker, and other automation technologies. My favorite programming language is Python, I am learning Golang, and I dabble in Binary Exploitation from time-to-time. I don't have any CVE's (yet!).
    You can see more of my work `here <https://github.com/rmccarth/>`_.
