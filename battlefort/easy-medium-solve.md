the value of your player name (e.g. 1, 2, 3) determines the randomness of your board. You can enter a super large/random number to have a more complex board meaning its harder for the enemy to hit your ships. Also on easy/medium difficulty the enemies ships are pretty consistently in the exact same place from round to round.
