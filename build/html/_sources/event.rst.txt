.. topic:: Holiday Hack and Kringlecon, What are they?  

    Kringlecon is an awesome virtual conference that takes part each year in mid December which hosts a range of security-relevant topics and discussions, and is open for free for everyone! This years sponsors were Google, SANS, and Splunk.

    Holiday Hack is the accompanying CTF-style adventure which introduces players to a range of challenges aimed at the Infosec begginer, all the way up to seasoned red teamers and threat hunters. The challenges are available ~indefinitely, and can be accessed at `2020.kringlecon.com <https://2020.kringlecon.com/>`_!

    I look forward to this event each year and would just like to say **thank you** to the folks at the CounterHack team that work so hard to make this free and educational for all of us.
    
    You really made 2020 a lot less random. 

    Thanks
